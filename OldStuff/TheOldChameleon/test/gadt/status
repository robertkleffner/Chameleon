eval.ch:

fails

JW: I think this should fail, since  0 :: Num a => a, and there's no Num in 
    any of the assumptions.

MS: correct!
    (btw, would work if instance Num Int exists)

gadt-fd.ch:

fails

JW: This fails because of the Num constraint and the fact that there
    are no built-in Num instances. 
    i.e. It works if you add: rule Num Int <=> True

MS: same thing
