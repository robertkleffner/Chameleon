 Chameleon's external language / AST
---------------------------------------
(see notes below)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTES:
  o This is almost the same syntax as Haskell 98, except we support:
    (features not in the original Chameleon are marked with an *)
  
    - rule declarations
    - overload declarations
    - extern declarations
    - contexts for data constructor (GRDTs)
